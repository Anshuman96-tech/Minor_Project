The main purpose of this paper is to create an algorithm to identify metastatic cancer in small image
patches taken from larger digital pathology scans.
Being able to automate the detection of metastasis cancer in pathological scans with machine learning
algorithms and deep neural networks is an area of medical imaging and diagnostics with favourable
potential for clinical usefulness. Modern medical image processing technologies work on histopathology
images apprehended by a microscope, and then examine them by using different algorithms and
procedures. Machine learning algorithms are now used for processing medical imagery and pathological
devices. Physical detection of a cancer cell is a monotonous process and involves human error, and hence
computer assisted mechanisms are applied to obtain better results as compared with manual pathological
detection systems. In deep learning, this is done by extracting features through a convolutional neural
network (CNN) and then classifying using a fully connected network.
